        <h4 id="item-1">Introduction</h4>
        <p>
        JR: 4, 3, 2, 1, boom! Thank you, thanks for doing this man. I really appreciate it. Very good to meet you.<br>
        <br>
        EM: You're welcome, nice to meet you too.<br>
        <br>
        JR: Thanks for not lighting this place on fire.<br>
        <br>
        EM: You're welcome.<br><br>
        </p>


        <h4 id="item-1-1">Flamethrowers</h4>
        <p>
        JR: How does one- in the middle of doing all the things you do, creating cars, rockets, all this stuff you&rsquo;re doing, just constantly innovating- decide to make a flamethrower? Where do you have time for that?<br>
        <br>
        EM: Well, we didn't put a lot of time into the flamethrower. This was an off-the-cuff thing. I have this sort of hobby company called the Boring Company, which started out as a joke. We decided to make it real and dig a tunnel under LA. Then other people asked us to dig tunnels, so we said yes in a few cases.<br>
        <br>
        EM: I&rsquo;m a big fan of Spaceballs the movie. In Spaceballs, Yogurt goes through the merchandising section, and they have a flamethrower. The kids love that one. I was like we should do a flame thrower.<br>
        <br>
        JR: Does anybody tell you no? Does anybody go, &ldquo;Elon, umm..?&rdquo;<br>
        <br>
        EM: Yeah, it's a terrible idea. <br>
        <br>
        JR: [Laughing]<br>
        <br>
        EM: Terrible. You shouldn&rsquo;t buy one. I said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t buy this flamethrower, don&rsquo;t buy it&rdquo;. Still, people bought it. There&rsquo;s nothing I could do to stop them.<br>
        <br>
        JR: If you build it, they will come.<br>
        <br>
        EM: It's a bad idea. It&rsquo;s dangerous. It&rsquo;s wrong. Don&rsquo;t buy it. And still people bought it, I couldn&rsquo;t stop them.<br>
        <br>
        JR: How many did you make?<br>
        <br>
        EM: 20,000.<br>
        <br>
        JR: [Snorts] [Laughing] And they&rsquo;re all gone?<br>
        <br>
        EM: It sold out in four days.<br>
        <br>
        JR: Are you going to do another run?<br>
        <br>
        EM: No.<br><br></p>


        <h4 id="item-1-2">Digging Holes</h4>
        <p>JR: But you do so many different things, forget about the flamethrower. How do you do all that other [stuff]? How does one decide to fix LA traffic by drilling holes in the ground and who do you even approach with that?<br>
        <br>
        EM: So far I&rsquo;ve lived in LA for 16 years and the traffic has always been terrible. I don&rsquo;t see any other ideas for improving the traffic, so in desperation we are going to dig a tunnel. And maybe that tunnel will be successful, and maybe it won&rsquo;t. <br>
        <br>
        JR: [blank stare] Uh, I'm listening.<br>
        <br>
        EM: I&rsquo;m not trying to convince you it's going to work.<br>
        <br>
        JR: When you&rsquo;re doing this, what&rsquo;s the ultimate plan?<br>
        <br>
        EM: Its in LA because I mostly live in LA. It's a terrible place to dig tunnels. One of the worst places to dig tunnels, mostly because of the paperwork. People think, what about the seismic, but tunnels are very safe in earthquakes.<br>
        <br>
        JR: Why is that?<br>
        <br>
        EM: Earthquakes are essentially surface phenomena, like waves in the ocean. If theres a storm, you want to be in a submarine.<br>
        <br>
        EM: It&rsquo;s constructed out of these interlocking segments. It&rsquo;s sort of like a snake exoskeleton with double seals. Even when the ground moves, the tunnel is able to shift along with the ground like an underground snake. It&rsquo;s extremely unlikely that both seals would be broken. It&rsquo;s capable of taking 5 atmospheres of pressure. <br>
        <br>
        EM: It meets all California seismic requirements<br><br></p>


        <h4 id="item-2">Existential Pit</h4>
        <p>JR: Do you have to give them a blueprint for your ultimate idea and they approve it? How does that work?<br>
        <br>
        EM: No, we just started off with a pit. A big pit. They don&rsquo;t really care about the existential nature of the pit. But hey, a hole in the ground is better than no hole in the ground.<br><br></p>


        <h4 id="item-3">Time Management</h4>
        <p>JR: I know how much time you must be spending on your Tesla factory, spaceX, and yet you still have time to dig holes under the ground in LA and come up with these ideas and then implement them.<br>
        <br>
        EM: I got a million ideas. There&rsquo;s no shortage of that.<br>
        <br>
        JR: I just don&rsquo;t know how you manage your time, I don&rsquo;t understand it. It doesn&rsquo;t even seem humanly possible. <br>
        <br>
        EM: I think people don&rsquo;t totally understand what I do with my time. They think I&rsquo;m like a business guy or something like that. My wikipedia page says &ldquo;business magnate&rdquo;.<br>
        <br>
        JR: What would you call yourself?<br>
        <br>
        EM: I&rsquo;m a business &ldquo;magnet&rdquo;. <br>
        <br>
        JR: [Laughing]<br>
        <br>
        EM: Can someone please change my wikipedia page to &ldquo;magnet&rdquo;? I want to be a magnet.<br>
        <br>
        JR: They&rsquo;ll change it right now. It&rsquo;s probably already changed.<br>
        <br>
        EM: I do engineering and manufacturing, that&rsquo;s like 80% or more of my time.<br>
        <br>
        JR: Ideas and then implementation of those ideas?<br>
        <br>
        EM: Well, it&rsquo;s like hardcore engineering, designing things. Structural, mechanical, electrical, software, user interface engineering, aerospace engineering.<br>
